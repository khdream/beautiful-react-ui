### âœ… Basic usage

```jsx
import { Card, Avatar, Paragraph } from 'beautiful-react-ui';

<Card>
  <Card.Image src="https://placeimg.com/460/250/nature" alt="A stunning title" />
  <Card.Title> 
    Pride and Prejudice
  </Card.Title>
  <Card.Content> 
    <Paragraph>
      Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. 
      A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.
    </Paragraph> 
  </Card.Content>
  <Card.Footer> 
    <Avatar src="https://placeimg.com/96/96/people" displayName="Jane Austen" size="small" state="online" />

    The creature
  </Card.Title>
  <Card.Content> 
    <Paragraph>
      Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
    </Paragraph> 
  </Card.Content>
  <Card.Footer> 
    <Avatar src="https://placeimg.com/120/120/people" displayName="Mary Shelley" size="small" state="online" />
